## Final Assessment/Evaluation

The site fulfils the most basic extent of the goals I set out with. 

I've reached all the requirements I set out with but not without bugs and problems in other areas.

The site loads in 2 seconds or less, works on different screen and web page sizes, is simple and decluttered in design, and has alt text for visually impaired users.

It only has 1 product page fully complete with all the others empty and the 'Home' product gallery sometimes bugs and moves around all over the page when you change the page size.

It is empty but usable. If a customer used it, they'd be able to work it, even if they'd be disappointed by the lack of content.

I would like to add more content for the other products but due to the time constaints, that's not possible. If I did add it, it would look the same as the 'Iphone 13' page but content to fit with that product.

The site functions well for its purpose, a customer who wishes to browse the stock of the store would be able to navigate the website and see if the product they're looking for is there very easily thanks to the simple and easy to understand design. There are contact details that allow a customer to contact the owners of the store if they do have questions regarding anything that isn't made clear within the site itself.
