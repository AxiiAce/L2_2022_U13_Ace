# Fonts

* It would be best to use sans serif fonts, preferably Arial, so the letters appear less crowded on the screen and it's easier tro read for dyslexic people

* Font size for normal writing should be 12-14 pt, while titles and such can be various larger sizes depending on the type of title (Heading, Subheading, etc.)

* White or black text depending on if the background is light or dark to aid in reading, avoid coloured text
