### Hex Values:

* 582A72 Purple
* 9D344B Pink
* 313975 Blue

* These 3 main colours are vibrant and eye catching, keeping the potential customer's attention and keeping them on the site longer

* Putting splashes of them throughtout the page that would mainly be white and black would provide a more modern and fun image

* The blue is the main colour of the brand and the shop. Providing the contrast of 2 other vibrant but similar colours would be a visually appealing eyecatcher (Clickbait you could say)
