* These 3 main colours are vibrant and eye catching, keeping the potential customer's attention and keeping them on the site longer

* Putting splashes of them throughtout the page that would mainly be white and black would provide a more modern and fun image

* The blue is the main colour of the brand and the shop. Providing the contrast of 2 other vibrant but similar colours would be a visually appealing eyecatcher (Clickbait you could say)

* Reminiscent of the colour scheme of a swamp, nobody wants to stare at a swamp for it's inspiring atmosphere

* Can make a website look childish when too many of these types of colours are on a screen at once

* The combinations of these colours together make up a frankly disgusting look that'd look more appropriate being thrown up during a bout of sickness than a professional website
