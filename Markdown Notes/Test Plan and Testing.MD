# Planned Tests for Functionality

* [**x**] Open the site in multiple browsers. Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Firefox.

  * Works on firefox. The site pages loaded in less than 2 second on firefox, the youtube video on the Iphone 13 page took 30 seconds to load in the first time,less than 2 seconds every time after that (Might've been because I've never used firefox before)
  * Works on Microsoft Edge. Quick loading on all fronts, video loaded in in 3 seconds.
  * Works on Chrome. Instant loading between pages, video loaded in after 1 second.

* [**x**] Test the site with different page/screen sizes.
  
  * When the home page is resized, the images bug out and move around and form large empty spaces when the screen is below a certain size/has specific proportions.
  * Other than that, the site works perfectly fine with differently sized pages.
